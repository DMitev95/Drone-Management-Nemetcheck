This project was assigned to us after the three lectures we had before the internship at Nemetschek. The lectures covered the basics of JS, OOP in JS, and Web Sockets. The project required us to perform drone deliveries from warehouses to clients, with coordinates of the warehouses and clients provided to us in 2D dimension. The goal was to simulate real-time delivery with status updates and calculate how many drones we needed to fulfill the deliveries within one working day.
